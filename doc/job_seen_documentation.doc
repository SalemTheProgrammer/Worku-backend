## Job Response Stats

When retrieving job details or job lists, each job object now includes statistics about views and applications:

```json
{
  "id": "6464a4e54f44d4b79c6c6a6b",
  "title": "Software Engineer",
  "stats": {
    "applicationsCount": 5,  // Number of candidates who applied
    "seenCount": 25         // Number of candidates who viewed the job
  },
  // ... other job fields
}
```

These statistics help companies track the engagement of their job postings by showing:
- How many candidates have viewed the job details
- How many candidates have applied to the position

This information can be used to:
- Measure the effectiveness of job postings
- Understand the conversion rate from views to applications
- Identify which jobs are generating the most interest
